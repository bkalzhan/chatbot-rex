This is a basic web application built using **Webpack** for module bundling, **Node.js** for the backend, and **Firebase** for the database. The application provides a simple interface to save data directly to the Firebase database.

## Features

- Save data from the user interface to the Firebase database.
- Built with Webpack for efficient module bundling and management.
- Uses Node.js to handle backend operations.
